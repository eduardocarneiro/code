     In Rust, the type of a variable is decided by the value you give it. Rust looks at the value and automatically chooses the right type:

    // Sample
    let my_num = 5;         // integer
    let my_double = 5.99;   // float
    let my_letter = 'S';    // character
    let my_bool = true;     // boolean
    let my_text = "Hello";  // string
